# What is this?

libvips-8.4.2-linux-x64.tar.gz  was taken from [https://dl.bintray.com/lovell/sharp/](https://dl.bintray.com/lovell/sharp/). This is the same tarball which contains the libvips library binaries if you were to build the sharp module on a Linux machine. We include it here so that it is possible to deploy the lambda function from any OS.
